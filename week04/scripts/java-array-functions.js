//Using the array.filter() method, create an array named namesB with only those names from the names array that start with the character 'B'.
let names = ['Nancy', 'Blessing', 'Jorge', 'Svetlana', 'Bob'];
let namesB = names.filter
    (name => name.charAt(0) === 'B');
//Using the array.map() method, create a new array named namesLength that contains the length of each name in the names array. Expected output is [5, 8, 5, 8, 3]
let nameLengths = names.map((name) => name.length);
//Using the names.reduce() method, create an expression that returns the average string length of the names in the names array. Expected output is 5.8.
names.reduce((total, name) => total + name.length, 0) / names.length;
//Above: NB: The initial value for the accumulator is set to 0. Inside the reducer function, total represents the accumulated sum of string lengths, and name represents each individual name in the array. The reducer function adds the length of each name to the total in each iteration (equivalent to total += name.length).
